# terraform-aws-datadog

Terraform module which sets up various AWS / Datadog integrations including:

- Configure Datadog's builtin AWS integration
- Configure Cloudtrail logshipping
- Create ELB S3 bucket for logs and logshipping
- Sync Cloudwatch logs for a given list of log groups


## Usage

**Set up all supported AWS / Datadog integrations**

```
module "datadog" {
  source                = "git::https://github.com/scribd/terraform-aws-datadog.git?ref=master"
  aws_account_id        = data.aws_caller_identity.current.account_id
  datadog_api_key       = var.datadog_api_key

  cloudtrail_bucket_id  = aws_s3_bucket.org-cloudtrail-bucket.id
  cloudtrail_bucket_arn = aws_s3_bucket.org-cloudtrail-bucket.arn

  cloudwatch_log_groups = ["cloudwatch_log_group_1", "cloudwatch_log_group_2"]
}
```

Note: The full integration setup should only be done within one terraform stack
per account since some of the resources it creates are global per account.
Creating this module in multiple terraform stacks will cause conflicts.


**Limit to only Cloudwatch log sync**

```
module "datadog" {
  source                         = "git::https://github.com/scribd/terraform-aws-datadog.git?ref=master"
  datadog_api_key                = var.datadog_api_key
  create_elb_logs_bucket         = false
  enable_datadog_aws_integration = false
  cloudwatch_log_groups          = ["cloudwatch_log_group_1", "cloudwatch_log_group_2"]
}
```

Note: It is safe to create multiple Cloudwatch only modules across different
Terraform stacks within a single AWS account since all resouces used for
Cloudwatch log sync are namspaced by module.


## Examples

* [Full AWS Datadog integration](https://github.com/scribd/terraform-aws-datadog/tree/master/examples/full_integration)
* [Cloudwatch log sync only](https://github.com/scribd/terraform-aws-datadog/tree/master/examples/cloudwatch_log_sync)


## Development

Releases are cut using [go-semrel-gitlab](https://gitlab.com/juhani/go-semrel-gitlab)

Format commit messages using [Conventional Commits format](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0-beta.2/) to determine the next version bump and to produce release notes

```
type(scope): subject
```
or

```
type: subject
```

Types:
```
minor bump: feat
patch bump: fix,refactor,perf,docs,style,tes
```

When a commit contains a breaking change, the commit message should contain `BREAKING CHANGE:`

## Troubleshooting

If you should encounter `Datadog is not authorized to perform action sts:AssumeRole Accounts affected: 1234567890, 1234567891 Regions affected: every region Errors began reporting 18m ago, last seen 5m ago`
Then perhaps the external ID has changed. Execute `./terraform taint module.datadog.datadog_integration_aws.core[0]` in the root module of the account repo to force a refresh.
